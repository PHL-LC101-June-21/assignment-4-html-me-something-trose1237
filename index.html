      2021's Drive Thru Photo's<br>

      <br>

      <p>I would like to thank everyone who came out for the drive thru and everyone who supported the team by purchasing shirts and/or donating! 
      This year was a little different since we drove thru instead of walked like we usually would. 
      Instead we decorated our cars and drove thru representing our team! 
      We still made the best of it and enjoyed ourselves!</p>
